<b>Currently Funded PhD Opportunities </b> <br>
We are currently seeking a PhD student to start ASAP on a project <b>X-ray analytics and ab initio simulation of energetic materials under extreme conditions <\b>. The project will combine state-of-the-art synchrotron science with ab initio simulation to investigate energetic materials at high pressurs. 

Further details are available and applications can be submitted: https://www.bam.de/umantis/EN/1105.html

<b>MSc Topics </b> <br>
We are happy to support students looking to conduct their MSc thesis research. We are actively pursuing research in the following areas, or are happy to discuss other projects with potential students.

1. Mechanically flexible single crystals <br>
Single crystals which show simultaneously functionality and mechanical flexibility offer a new direction for next-generation materials. Their potential for flexible electronics, wave guides, and magnetic materials have been already demonstrated. Selectively designing materials with mechanical flexibility remains, however, a significant challenge. Correspondingly, it is not yet possible to realise the full potential of these advanced materials.
The aim of the master thesis project is the explore the atomistic origin for mechanical flexibility in small molecule single crystals. In doing so, this project seeks to develop design strategies for the targeted design of next generation mechanically functional materials. The project will include the experimental preparation and characterization of new mechanically flexible materials by single crystal X-ray diffraction and microfocus Raman spectroscopy. Experimental characterization will be supplemented by atomistic simulations.

2. Mechanochemisry of Explosive Materials <br>
Energetic materials (explosives, propellants, and pyrotechnics; EMs) are an important class of functional material with both civilian and defense applications. For example, EMs play a central role in construction and mining, and are used in every-day life as fireworks and Christmas crackers. EMs are characterized by the rapid release of large quantities of energy in response to external perturbation. Understanding what perturbations lead to release of this energy is paramount to the successful and safe use of EMs. Despite decades of research, there remains very little understood regarding how EMs initiate thus rendering a priori and in silico design of EMs largely impossible.
Following from our recent success in developing ab initio models for EM reactivity based on vibrational energy transfer mechanisms,1-3 this project will seek to extend this model towards a more diverse set of molecular explosives. This project will combine ab initio modeling techniques of both crystalline solids and molecules to identify critical design features which dictate EM reactivity. The project will be conducted in close collaboration with partners at the University of Edinburgh, UK. The MSc candidate should have interest in quantum chemical simulation of materials and molecules and possess knowledge of programming in python.
