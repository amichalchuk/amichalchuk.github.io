We combine atomistic simulation and experiment to study the mechanisms and processes involved in mechanically induced reactions in molecular solids. We have particular interest in the role of phonon dynamics in dictating material mechanical response. Experimentally, we make extensive use of large scale international facilities including both synchrotron and neutron facilities. <br> <br>

<b> ENERGETIC MATERIALS </b> <br>
Energetic materials (explosives, propellants, and pyrotechnics) release large amounts of energy when initiated by various stimuli such as mechanical impact and friction. Understanding how mechanical stimuli lead to energetic material initiation is an exceptional challenge, and holds the key to designing better and safer materials. We are developing new theoretical approaches to understand the mechanochemistry of energetic materials with the aim of establishing better fundamental insights into their reactivity. We are particularly interested in how material dynamics influence mechanochemical reactivity. Our theoretical developments are complemented closely by experimental studies including material response to extreme pressure and temperature. <br><br> A few of our recent papers include: <br>
