This is the website for the research team led by Dr Adam Michalchuk at the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM). We are exploring how mechanical force can lead be use to manipulate solid material and cause chemical and physical transformations. Our work enjoys close interplay between simulation and experiment, including extensive use of international synchrotron and neutron facilities.
