Originally from the west coast of Canada, I moved to Scotland where I obtained my MChem from the University of Edinburgh in 2014. I remained in Edinburgh to pursue my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Colin Pulham and Prof. Carole Morrison, developing a theoretical framework with which to predict the mechanical reactivity of energetic materials. Theoretical work was combined closely with Inelastic Neutron Scattering Spectroscopy. During this time I simultaneously pursued a second PhD-level qualification from Novosibirsk State University (Russia) under supervision of Prof. Dr Elena Boldyreva, studying experimentally the mechano-chemical reactivity of organic solids. Following my PhD studies in 2018, I moved to Berlin for post-doctoral research with Dr Habil. Franziska Emmerling developing synchrotron-based techniques (X-ray diffraction and X-ray spectroscopy) for time-resolved in situ studies of mechanochemical reactions. Since 2019 I am a guest scientist in the group of Prof. Dr Beate Paulus (Free University Berlin), developing theoretical models to further investigate the mechanical behaviour of crystalline materials. Since 2021 I am a Senior Scientist at the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM), leading my a team that interfaces experiment and simulation in hopes of elucidating how and why molecular solids react under mechanical force.
