Our new paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26264-1"> Changing the game of time resolved X-ray diffraction on the mechanochemistry playground by downsizing </a>
was just published in Nature Communications! In collaboration with colleagues at University of Cambridge and University of Parma we develop a new approach for time-resolved in situ (TRIS) X-ray diffraction that sheds unprecedented detail of mechanochemical transformations.
